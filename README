This module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password
files. These files (and htaccess) are used to do Basic Authentication
on a web server.

The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated
crypted password.


INSTALLATION

You install Apache::Htpasswd, as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   make clean

DOCUMENTATION

POD style documentation is included in the module.  
These are normally converted to manual pages and installed as part 
of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use 
the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read documentation from the 
module files directly.


AVAILABILITY

The latest version of Apache::Htpasswd should always be available from:

    $CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/K/KM/KMELTZ/
